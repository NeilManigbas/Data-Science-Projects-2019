About this project
•	A project based on Home Equity Loan dataset with 5,960 mortgage applicants
•	Produced good logistic model for prediction with concordance rate of 89.3% and predicted delinquent rate of 96.4% in top quantile
•	Performed simple dataset content procedure to understand the data
•	Converted character values to numerical by creating dummy variable for data preparation
•	Partitioned observations into groups based on ranks
•	Created a macro function to plot and tabulate Log Response Ratio to find out the average value to fill into the missing values
•	Determined important drivers and suppressors for the final model by stepwise selection procedure
•	Created and visualized a lift chart using SAS Proc Tabulate and MS Excel to evaluate the performance of the model
•	Used Max-KS test to validate model performance
